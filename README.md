# Contact-Book-App
A simple app for listing contacts programmed in Python

I made this app as part of a project in Coddy. I thought it was a relatively longer project compared to the normal practice.
I made some changes to the original code to make it more presentable and usable. For example, I added instructions to the user for getting the input.

App functions:
- Add contacts
- View specific contact
- Edit a contact
- Delete contact
- List all contacts

It is executed in a Python 3 environment. Either copy the code to one online or execute in your terminal, if you have Pyhton installed.

You can download this file and execute with bash
python contactapp.py
