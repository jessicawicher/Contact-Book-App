# Contact-Book-App
A simple app for listing contacts programmed in Python

I made this app as part of a project in Coddy. I thought it was a relatively longer project compared to the normal practice.
I made some changes to the original code to make it more presentable and usable. For example, I added instructions to the user for getting the input.

App functions:
- Add contacts
- View specific contact
- Edit a contact
- Delete contact
- List all contacts

It is executed in a Python 3 environment. For example, you can try it on Google Collab.

Either copy the code to the online environment or execute it in your terminal, if you have Python installed.

You can download the file and execute it with bash
python contactsapp.py

After that, follow the instructions shown on the terminal.
